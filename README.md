# SINGLE-SHOT-DETECTION
This repository contains two algorithms implemented . They are as follows:
- Single Shot Detection - state of the art for object detection , has a very robust neural net implemented inside it .
                          we have rendered the video frame-wise and applied ssd onto it , finally get the bounding box
                          on all the frames , frames joined together to render objects detected in video ```output.mp4```
                     
- Imageai - Very robust model for object detection , with very few lines of code it is possible to detect objects in 
          image/video
